# EBS volume 
- Elastic Block Store
- a network drive you can attach - NOT PHYSICAL
- attach one instance at a time -> one ec2 can have multiple EBS tho
- detach from ec2 and attach another
- bound to a specific availability zone -> us-east-1a != us-east-1b

- "network USB stick"

# EBS 
- root default -> delete on termination O
- new default -> delete on termiation X

# EBS snapshots
- make a backup of EBS volume
- EBS1 -> snapshot -> EBS1-snapshot can attach another ec2

## snapshot Archive
- move snapshot to "Archive tier" that is 75% cheaper
- takes within 24 ~ 72 hrs for restoring

## snapshot Recycle Bin
- setup roles to retain ..
- specify retention 

## Fast Snapshot Restore(FSR)($$$)
- force full initialization of snapshot to have no latency on the first use($$$)

# AMI(Amazon Machine Image)
- a template image to create ec2 
- to create ec2 quickly and make them the same environment !

# EC2 Instance Store
- high performance , I/O ..!

# EBS Volume Types
- GP2/GP3 (SSD) - General Purpose
- io1/io2 Block Express - highest-performance ssd
- st1(HDD) - low cost - freq access workload
- sc1(HDD) - low cost - less access workload

* gp, io can be boot volumes

# EBS multi-attach - io1/io2 family
- attach the same EBS volumn to multiple ec2 instances in the same AZ
- each instance has full read and write permissions
- up to 16 ec2 instances at a time

# EBS Encryption
1. create ebs snapshot of the volume
2. encrypt the ebs snapshot
3. create new ebs volume from the snapshot(volume also encrypted)
4. attach encrypted volume to the original instance

# EFS - Elastic File System
- NFSv4 protocol
- SG to control access to EFS
- compatible with Linux based AMI, WINDOWS X
- encryption 
- POSIX file system - api

# QUIZ
Q. You can use an AMI in N.Virginia Region us-east-1 to launch an EC2 instance in any AWS Region.
A. False - built for a specific AWS region. but copy ami to the target region and then creat ec2 with it

Q. What is EBS Multi-Attach?
A. Attach the same EBS volume to multiple ec2 instances in the same az

Q. Use EFS
A. EFS is a network file system that allows you to mount the same file system on EC2 instances that are in different AZs.

Q. High-performance local cache
A. Instance Store(the best dist I/O performance)

Q. You are running a high-performance database that requires an IOPS of 310,000 for its underlying storage
A. Use EC2 Instance Storage
