# Scalability - can handle greater loads by adapting
## vertical scalability
- (UP)increasing "size" of instance eg) t2.micro -> m2.large
- common for non distributed systems -> DB
- RDS, ElastiCache..
- hardware limit
- scale up / down

## horizontal scalability(Elasticity
- increasing "number" of instance eg) 1 * t2.micro -> 2 * t2.micro
- disbributed systems
- wep application/ modern application
- EC2...
- scale out(+) / in(-)

# High Availability
- hand in had with horizontal scaling
- means running apps/systems at least 2 data centers( == AZ)
- to survice a data center loss
- passive -> RDS multi AZ
- active -> Horizontal scaling

# ELB
- health check
- 4types of LB
  1. Classic CLB - depreciated
  2. Application ALB
  3. Networt NLB
  4. Gateway GLB

## ALB
- layer 7(Http)
- routing
- great fit for MS or container-based app(ECS)
- target groups
