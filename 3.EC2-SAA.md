# Private vs Public IP(IPv4)
- Public - unique on web
- Private - can be the same on different companies

# Elastic IP
- stop -> start ec2 -> changed public ip
- need fixed public ip? -> Elastic IP
- can attach one ec2
- 5 Elastic IP per account

# Placement Groups
- Cluster: low-latency group in single AZ
- Spread: across underlying hadware max7 instances per group per AZ - critical applications
- Partition: across many different partitions, scale to 100s of EC2 per group

## 1. Cluster
- Pros: Same AZ -> many instance -> so fast ! 10Gbps network.
- Cons: if the AZ fails, all fails at the same time
- Use case: Big data job, low latency and high network job

## 2. Spread
- Pros: diffrent AZ, differnt hadware -> risk is low of simultaneous failure
- Cons: limited to 7 instances per AZ per placement group
- Use case: maximize high availability, each instance must be isolated from failure from each other

## 3. Partitions
- up to 7 partitions per AZ
- can span multiple AZs in the same region
- Up to 100s EC2 instances
- use cases: Hadoop Distributed File System, HBase, Cassandra, Kafka

# Elastic Network Interfaces(ENI)
- it is like a Indentification of Network
- logical component in a VPC that represents a Vitual Network Card
- Primary private IPv4, one or more secondary IPv4
- One Elastic IP per Private IPv4
- one Public IPv4
- One or more security groups
- A MAC address
- A EC2 ENI can move to B EC2 for failover -> safe!
- Bound to a specific AZ

# Questions for myself
- AWS: a big city
- VPC: a District in my city that I own
- Subnet: a block in my district
- ec2: my server in my subnet
